   actix-async does not provide blocking actor feature.

   This example shows how to use supervisor to run a pool of actor that run blocking jobs in async
   context.

   It has more overhead than pure blocking thread pool due to the cost of async runtime.
   In exchange the design of lib is simpler and have a good mix usage of blocking and async.
